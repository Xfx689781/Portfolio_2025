      <h2>1. JavaScript Review</h2>
      <p>Diving deep into JavaScript fundamentals, reviewing what I've learned about JavaScript in grade 11, and did some JavaScript-HTML interactions.</p>
      <p>February 17: learned about the javascript console and the document output using javascript.</p>
      <p>February 18: learned about the variables in javascript, where you need to define the variable using "var" or "let", then using the variables to do outputs.</p>
      <p>February 19: learned about mathematics in javascript, where you define variables and using them in some calculations for the outputs.</p>
      <p>February 20~24: learned about functions and function parameters in javascript. A function in javascript would help you do the task by combining some process together and "store" them, so that when you're going to use the function, just call the function.</p>
      <p>February 25~26: learned about javascript-HTML interactions, which includes event listeners and links through different coding files, while adding some CSS between these codes.</p>
      <p>February 27~28: the final project of this unit, which is the geometry calculator. This website aims to calculate the areas and volumes of some geometrical figures using the interaction between HTML and javascript. You are expected to see this website in "example projects" page.</p>

      <p>Exploring the emerging technologies and popular trends in computer science, and do some in-depth research while completing a website for it.</p>
      <p>March 4: the day of completing the Google Form to choose the topics. I chose artificial intelligence to research.</p>
      <p>March 5~6: started to do some research about artificial intelligence, and made a short section of introduction and outline about the project, while started the cover page of the website.</p>
      <p>Following Wednesdays: started the history page of artificial intelligence, from "level 1" (the 1940s) all the way to level 10 (2025).</p>
     <p>June: Unfortunately, there's no enough class-time for the project to complete, thus it was cancelled, and you're not expected to see this project in my "example project" page.</p>

      <h2>3. Abstract Data Types (ADT)</h2>
      <p>Exploring data organization with stacks, queues, and linked lists, understanding how these structures help solve complex problems efficiently.</p>
      <p>March 31: this was the day that the individual project of abstract data types has started. Each student needed to choose three of the data types to research, as well as making slides and quizzes.</p>
      <p>April 1: I learned stacks, the first type of abstract data types on that day. A stack follows the LIFO (last in, first out) rule with a series of element that the one you add the latest get out the first. Meanwhile, push, pop and peak are the most common commands used in a stack, with push adds elements to the front, pop deletes elements from the front, and peak finds the top element.</p>
      <p>April 2: I learned queues on that day. A queue follows the FIFO (first in, first out) rule so that it's more like elements lining up, so that the element added the earliest would be deleted the earliest. Dequeque, enqueue and peak would be the most common commands, with dequeue deletes elements, enqueue add elements and peak finds the top element.</p>
      <p>April 3: I learned linked lists on that day. Different from a queue or a stack, a linked list is more sequenced than the other ADTs. There are single and double-ended linked lists, which single-ended lists could only run in one direction, while double-ended lists would go from two directions. Append, remove and insert are the common commands used in linked lists, with append adds elements, removes deletes elements and insert add elements in specific index.</p>
      <p>April 7~9: On these days I got into a group with Vlad, Tony and Aryan, with each group member presents different ADTs. Vlad researched about stacks, Tony researched aboubt BSTs, Aryan researched about hash tables while I researched about linked lists and queues. We changed our slides for a bit by combining each member's slides together, while I made the quiz.</p><div class="arrow"></div>
      <p>April 15: This was the day of ADT presentation. Our group talked about the five kinds of abstract data types and did the quiz and assignment.</p><div class="arrow"></div>
      <p>April 26~28: On these days, Mr. Jamieson assigned the final assignment (group assignment) of abstract data types, where students need to write a code to reverse the strings using queues / stacks. Assignment was finished on April 28.</p><div class="arrow"></div>

      <h2>4. Linux</h2>
      <p>Getting hands-on experience with Linux command line, file system, and different systems with Git. Lead by the three tutors (especially Samy) from the CSE group every Fridays from March 7.</p>
      <p>March 7: this was the first day of CSE, and we learned about linux basics, including the command lines cd, ls, cat and exit.</p>
      <p>March 21: on that day, more command are learned and used, including mv, mkdir, touch, rm, rmdir, chmod and sort. Also, we learned the help pages, absolute and non-absolute (relaive) paths, creating and moving files and redirecting files.</p>
      <p>March 25: this was the day of linux quiz, with a total of 20 multiple choices questions.</p>
      <p>March 28: on that day, we started to learn the second part of the CSE tutorial: Git. We used the command git init to initialize Git, while add and stage them by using git add and git status, and commit messages using git commit -m. Git branch are also used in many situations especially when new branches are nessasary to be created. The command git branch is used to create a branch while git checkout is used to checkout a branch.</p>
      <p>April 3: this was the day of git quiz, which also includes 20 multiple choices questions.</p>

      <h2>5. PyGamer Tutorial</h2>
      <p>Creating interactive games with Python, learning to design engaging gameplay mechanics and control user input.</p>
      <p>May 5: this was the first day of Pygamer Tutorial, where students are assigned to learn the 13 Pygamer lessons independently using a tutorial online, while completing the form to indicate what was good and bad in the tutorials. I learned lessons 1~4 on that day. Lesson 1 tells the initial set-up of a Pygamer, where people need to create a file called circuitpy and put the py (python) code-files in to the circuitpy file for running the code with the Pygamer. Lesson 2 talks about the lay-out and background-setting of the Pygamer game, where people need to use python code to upload a background image of universe to the Pygamer. Lesson 3 aims to add the sprites to the Pygamer, which refers to another layer of background. Lesson 4 aims to add a button on the Pybadge in order to show the sprites up. </p>
      <p>May 6: I learned lessons 5 and 6 on that day. Lesson 5 explained the methods to make the Sprites move, while lesson 6 aims to add some sound effects into the Pygamer. Lesson 6 didn't go really well due to the sound issues on the computer. Meanwhile, a miserable fact happened on that day was the Pygamer couldn't run well (maybe due to some technical or syntax issues).</p>
      <p>May 7: I learned lessons 7~10 on that day. Lesson 7 aims to add a menu scene by creating a new file called constants.py to the Pygamer. Lesson 8 adds the splash scene (another scene that's parallel to sprites and aliens) to the Pygamer. Lesson 9 and 10 continues to deal with the lasers and aliens, where lesson 9 aims to add lasers and make the lasers move around the screen, and lesson 10 uses a function called show_alien() to show the aliens in the screen and get more than one layer of aliens.</p>
      <p>May 8: I learned lessons 11~13 on that day. These lessons essentially set up the game score and count of aliens while set for the game-over scenes (that deal with the back-end). Lesson 11 sets up the score variable and the alien count. Lesson 12 deals with the score count (when you beat an alien you earn some score) which is basically based on lesson 11. Lesson 13, the final lesson sets up the game-over scene, where if the aliens get out of the screen or you fail to catch an amount of aliens, the game would come to an end.</p>
      <p>May 12: on that day, all the codes were finished so that I enhanced my writings on the google docs of rating what's good and bad on the Pygamer tutorials.</p>

      <h2>6. The Internet Library (aka. AshStone Project)</h2>
      <p>A collaborative project blending programming skills with creativity to build a unique interactive digital experience with Carlee, Desmond, Chris and Ayden, lasting from February to June (a long journey).</p>
      <p>February 7: I was assigned to be in the group with Carlee Hughes, Desmond Lassaline, Chris Abraham and Ayden Ruesink. We did the AshStone proposal on that day and Carlee became the group leader. Carlee sets up a document called "Game Brainstorming" and a slides to give an outline of the project, and at the same time we decided to name the project "The Internet Library" as it would be a web-app for teachers and students in All Saints High School to find their textbooks online.</p>
      <p>February 10~14: on these days, our group got a name (by voting) called "The Tech Titans" (TTT). On these days, we continued to make our outline and AshStone proposal for the Internet Library project, with our presentation on February 14.</p>
      <p>February 24: this was basically the first day that our group "The Tech Titans" started the project. We planned to make five parts in "The Internet Library", including a home page, a content page, a gallery page, an "about us" page, and a login-sign-up complex.</p>
      <p>February 25: this day was the report day, where our group (basically Carlee) made a document of reporting what we've done and our work-plans for the next few days. However, our project was just started on that day, and... basically I was assigned by Carlee to complete the index and about-us pages.</p>
      <p>March 17~21: this week was the first week that our group made a visible progress on "The Internet Library". I completed the index and abou-us pages, where I introduced main idea, the functionalities and comment/review functions in "index" page and introduced the five group members (their responsibilities) and the work-plan in "about us" page. (the two pages are renamed "about us" and "the team" in May)</p>
      <p>March 24: this day was the first milestone (big report) on "The Internet Library". I started to write the report while Carlee discovered that (so from that day she made me the reporter, so that I needed to write every report/milestones since that one). The group had done a lot in that period, with the barebone of the web-app including the index page, the about-us page, the outline of gallery page, the sign-up and login page and the comment/review page.</p>
      <p>March 28: that was an important day because on that day, our group changed a repository so that all the following stuffs happened in a different repository.</p>
      <p>April 14: the second major working period of "The Internet Library" has started, with our second work-plan (being updated).</p>
      <p>April 16: this was an important day for me because I have completed the search bar in the gallery page on that day. By using searchbar.js as a back-end program, the search bar allows users to search whatever textbook they want, and it filters the names of the textbooks that include what you search. More specifically, I did this by giving each textbook an ID code, where the JavaScript program compares the ID codes of the textbooks with what you search for, while when your input corresponds to any ID codes of the textbooks, it will filter them out and only display them on the screen. </p>
      <p>April 17: this was the day for the second milestone (I wrote it and Carlee revised it). On that day we had completed the most parts of the web-app, with a major update on the styling (so that the styling became pretty similar to the final version). We also completed the full comment/review pages and the gallery page (except some textbooks are unavailable). We were still working on the login-sign-up complex at that time.</p>
      <p>May 13: this was the starting of the third major working period of "The Internet Library", with the major tasks of finding unavailable textbooks, establishing login-sign-up complex and make some styling changes. (like the light mode and dark mode).</p>
      <p>May 14: the third milestone day, where we had done most of the parts of the website, including the outline (skeleton website), the gallery design and the index / introduction parts + light & dark modes!</p>
      <p>June 2~6: the fourth and last major working period of "The Internet Library". I did a new figure on the search bar that when you search for the teachers' names, the corresponding textbook appears. Meanwhile, we checked all the information and links in the web-app to make sure that everything is good.</p>
      <p>June 9~10: these were the testing days, where people are welcomed to test the websites and find any issues on them.</p>
      <p>June 13: this day was the final submission of "The Internet Library", and the final project was OUT!</p> <div class="arrow"></div>

      <h2>7. mBot2 Testing</h2>
      <p>Learning robotics basics and programming using mBot2 and examine the tutorials for elementary students.</p>
      <p>May 2: The CSE crew (Samy) sent two robots (mBot2) to Mr. J's classrooom so that people get into two groups to constructing the robots.</p>
      <p>May 9: Samy's crew bought more robots to ensure that everyone would get one. I constructed my own mBot2 robot on that day. Mr. J sent the lessons and I previewed them (including a google docs for writing down what is good and what is bad & improvements on the tutorials). I finished the first tutorial.</p>
      <p>May 16: Completed tutorials 2 and 3, and looked forward (preview) to tutorial 4, but haven't completed the google docs for those tutorials yet.</p>
      <p>June 11~13: Wisdom teeth was removed on June 11 (missed that day of school) so that I hurried up for the remaining lessons on June 12 and June 13, and finally, I finished the document of what is good & bad, and gave some specific suggestions on the improvements of the tutorials (for elementary school students).</p>
